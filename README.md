# Jekyll Starter Update

Well this is embarassing.. 

- Basically, couldn't get Jekyll 3.6.2 to work (Surface Pro 2017, Windows 10 Build 16299.125
- So.. Factory reset, apt-get'd all the things, including Jekyll 3.0.1.
- This is a clean starter, no styles from ancient Jekyll.. Good to go. 
- MAYBE I'll work in Livereload/Browser Refresh
- Hopefully I can figure updated Jekyll out eventually.
